    <p> This was a fun site, I like how it shows elements of motion design. </p>

    <a href="https://www.guessthepin.com/">guess the pin </a> <br>
    <p> Another cool site that is definitely a lot more simple, but I'm sure this is a valuable project or something similiar to learn how to code. </p>
